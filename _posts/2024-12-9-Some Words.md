4. Rather than escape, **overcome** the problem if it is important. 
5. (Learn from **Shiyu Chang**) ***A job well done is its own reward. You take pride in the things you do, not for others to see, not for the respect, or glory, or any other rewards it might bring.** **You take pride in what you do, because you're doing your best.** **If you believe in something, you stick with it.** **When things get difficult, you try harder.***
6. (Learn from **Open AI**) Develop **simple** but **generalized** algorithm.
7. (Learn from **Faynman**) What I cannot **understand**, what I cannot create.
